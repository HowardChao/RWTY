To Do List for RWTY:

Hook the plot.cladevar stuff into the single chain analyses


Fix point and text sizes for compare plot with lots of comparisons
Get Anthony working on discordance metric
Add discordance as a function of time and clustering of chains based on discordance - a tree of chains for chains of trees!
Put together some executable examples with data that will be distributed with the package.  Make sure to include .p files.
Fix alpha on compare.n plots, ditch the grids
Print burnin and other relevant settings on plots
Something’s going wrong with labels.  At some point it’s deparsing label names and a space between words (or is it just a word and a number?) is causing it to fail.  In other words “Run 1” won’t work as a label but “Run1” will.
UPDATE ON THIS:  Seems unfixable, from what I’m finding on Google.

Store arguments and trees in the output object - perhaps thinning the trees that are stored?

Make sure Dave is working on distance code.
Include option to skip treespace plots, since they take a while and are only kinda informative.
