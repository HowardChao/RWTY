To Do List for RWTY:

Hook the plot.cladevar stuff into the single chain analyses
Parse gens.per.tree automatically from tree file (compare tree 2 and 3)
Multipanel plots for each chain with slide, cumulative, treespace, clade var, LnL, etc
Drop the multi-chain treespace plots for now - take too long
Put together some executable examples with data that will be distributed with the package.  Make sure to include .p files.
Fix alpha on compare.n plots, ditch the grids
Fix legend in treespace plots
Get main titles on all plots
Print burnin and other relevant settings on plots
Store arguments and trees in the output object - perhaps thinning the trees that are stored?
Trim chain function - trim chains on input in load.trees?
Make sure Dave is working on distance code.
Include option to skip treespace plots, since they take a while and are only kinda informative.
