RWTY: R We There Yet?
======================
  This package implements various tests, visualizations, and metrics for diagnosing convergence of MCMC chains in phylogenetics. It implements and automates many of the functions of the AWTY package in the R environment. It also adds a whole bunch of new functionality.

# Installation

At present, RWTY is downloadable from GitHub.  There are multiple ways to download it.  The easiest is to run the following code from your R console:
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("danlwarren/RWTY/tree/master/rwty")
```

Alternatively, you can navigate to the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/danlwarren/RWTY.  Click the "Download Zip" button in the bottom right, and select a location to save RWTY to on your computer.


# Interacting with RWTY
Most users will only need to interact directly with two RWTY functions: load.trees() and analyze.rwty():
