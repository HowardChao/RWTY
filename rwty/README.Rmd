RWTY: R We There Yet?
======================
This package implements various tests, visualizations, and metrics for diagnosing convergence of MCMC chains in phylogenetics. It implements and automates many of the functions of the AWTY package in the R environment. It also adds a whole bunch of new functionality.

# Installation

At present, RWTY is downloadable from https://github.com/danlwarren/RWTY.  There are multiple ways to download it.  The easiest is to run the following code from your R console:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("danlwarren/RWTY")
```



# Interacting with RWTY
